2. **Be specific** - Reference something specific about them or their work
3. **Make it easy** - Suggest specific times or ask for a brief response
4. **Follow up once** - If no response after 1 week, send one gentle follow-up
5. **Add value** - Offer something in return when possible
6. **Proofread** - Typos and errors make a bad first impression
7. **Personalize** - Never send a generic mass email
