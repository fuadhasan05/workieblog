## ⏰ Time Management Strategies

### The Time Blocking Method
Divide your day into blocks dedicated to specific types of work:

| Time | Block Type | Activities |
|------|-----------|------------|
| 8:00-9:00 | 🌅 Morning Startup | Email, planning, light tasks |
| 9:00-11:30 | 🧠 Deep Work | Most challenging/important work |
| 11:30-12:00 | 📞 Communication | Calls, messages, quick meetings |
| 12:00-1:00 | 🍽️ Lunch Break | Step away from your desk! |
| 1:00-3:00 | 🤝 Collaboration | Meetings, team work |
| 3:00-4:30 | 🔧 Execution | Tasks, follow-ups |
| 4:30-5:00 | 📋 Wrap-up | Tomorrow's prep, final emails |

### The Pomodoro Technique
1. Choose a task
2. Set timer for 25 minutes
3. Work with full focus
4. Take 5-minute break
5. After 4 pomodoros, take 15-30 minute break

### Eat the Frog
Do your most dreaded or important task first thing in the morning when willpower is highest.
