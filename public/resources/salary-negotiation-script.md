## Key Tips

1. **Never accept the first offer** - There's almost always room for negotiation
2. **Let them name a number first** - If asked about salary expectations early, deflect with "I'd like to learn more about the role first"
3. **Practice out loud** - Rehearse your script until it feels natural
4. **Be confident, not aggressive** - Negotiation is a collaboration, not a confrontation
5. **Get everything in writing** - Once you reach an agreement, ask for an updated offer letter
